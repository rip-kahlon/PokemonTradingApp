# PokemonTradingApp

This is a really simple pokemon trading app that shows Daml modeling in action. We create a module, a couple of templates, and a variety of choices allowing users to reject, accept, and mofiy trades. There'a a simple test script which can be run within VSCode, and this can also be tested using Daml Navigator.
